# MantraOS ‚ú®

**MantraOS** is a motivational PWA supercharged with on-device AI, submitted to the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025. It's designed to excel in the **"Best Multimodal AI Application"** category by transforming spoken intentions into powerful, personalized mantras.

Speak your goals, and the app's privacy-preserving, on-device AI crafts affirmations for you. This core multimodal feature is complemented by AI-powered translation, rephrasing, and grammar correction, all running offline in a fast, zero-dependency vanilla JavaScript application.
