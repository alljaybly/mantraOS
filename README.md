## ü§î How It Works

MantraOS is designed for simplicity and performance. The entire application is a **single, self-contained `index.html` file**.

- **State Management:** A global JavaScript `state` object holds all user data, including mantras, settings, and progress.
- **Local Persistence:** The `localStorage` API is used to save the entire application state. This ensures that all your data is stored securely on your device and is available even when you're offline.
- **Client-Side Logic:** There is no backend server. All logic, from rendering views to tracking progress, is handled directly in the user's browser, making it fast and private.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** The UI is dynamically rendered using vanilla JavaScript functions that generate HTML strings and mount them to the DOM. This approach avoids the need for heavy frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN) for rapid, utility-first styling.
- **Icons:** [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) embedded as SVG functions.
- **Deployment:** Can be hosted on any static web hosting service (like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Since this is a vanilla web application, there is no complex build process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mantra-os.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mantra-os
    ```

3.  **Run locally:**
    You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. However, for the best experience and to enable Progressive Web App (PWA) features like the "Install App" button, you must serve the files from a local web server. This is because modern browser security policies restrict PWA features to `http` or `https` protocols, not the `file://` protocol used when opening files directly.

    Here are a few ways to start a local server:

    #### Using Node.js
    If you have Node.js installed, you can use a simple package like `serve`.

    1.  **Install `serve` globally (one-time setup):**
        ```bash
        npm install -g serve
        ```
    2.  **Run the server from the project directory:**
        ```bash
        serve .
        ```
    
    An alternative to `serve` is `live-server`, which automatically reloads the page when you make changes.
    1.  **Install `live-server` globally:** `npm install -g live-server`
    2.  **Run it:** `live-server`

    #### Using Python
    If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in web server.

    -   For Python 3:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    -   For Python 2:
        ```bash
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```

    #### Using VS Code
    If you use Visual Studio Code, a popular and easy-to-use option is the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Once installed, you can right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".

    After starting the server with any of these methods, open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser to use the application.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project has been intentionally consolidated to simplify its architecture:

-   `index.html`: The core of the application. Contains all HTML, CSS (via Tailwind config and style blocks), and JavaScript logic.
-   `README.md`: This file.
-   `manifest.json`: The Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest file.
-   `icon-192.svg` / `icon-512.svg`: App icons used for the PWA.
-   `metadata.json`: Project metadata.
-   `index.tsx`, `service-worker.js`, etc.: These files are intentionally blank or unused. The project was refactored into a single HTML file to resolve critical errors and simplify the stack.
